****
The PDF Protector Model is a tool designed to help you keep your PDF documents safe and secure. Imagine you have important documents, like school assignments, personal notes, or official papers, and you want to make sure no one else can open or change them without your permission. This tool can help you do that!

**Key Parts of the PDF Protector Model:**

**PyPDF2 Library:**

PyPDF2 is like a smart assistant for working with PDF files. It helps you read, write, and modify PDF documents.

In our model, PyPDF2 is used to add security features to your PDFs, such as passwords and permissions.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):**

The GUI is like the face of the tool that you interact with. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, so you don't need to be a computer expert to use it.

With the GUI, you can click on buttons and menus to do things like select a PDF file, set a password, and save the protected file.

**Main Features:**

**1.Password Protection:**

You can set a password for your PDF files. This means that only people who know the password can open the document and read its contents.

**2.Permissions Settings:**

You can decide what other people can do with your PDF. For example, you can allow them to read the document but not print it or copy text from it.

**3.Batch Processing:**

If you have many PDFs to protect, you can do it all at once instead of one by one. This feature is called batch processing and it saves you a lot of time.

**4.Cross-Platform Compatibility:**

This means that the tool can work on different types of computers, whether you have a Windows PC, a Mac, or a Linux machine. So, you can protect your PDFs no matter what kind of computer you use.
